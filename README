RetardaseInhibitor
==================

It is difficult to generate URLs with ActionMailer. Although you can generate 
absolute paths from your routes, you usually need to generate full URLs for 
the links in the email to be useful to your recipients.

This plugin sets the default_url_options for host, port and protocol by 
providing an around_filter which will grab the values from the request object.
In the cases when the request object is not available, for example, when 
running tests, default values are set instead. 

See the following blog post for more details:

Usage
=====

Add the around_filter to the ApplicationController to set the 
default_url_options for every request.

    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      around_filter :retardase_inhibitor
    end

I prefer to add it just around the actions when I know an Observer will kick 
off an ActionMailer notifier. For example, I have an the filter kick off in 
my SessionsController#create when I process a user signup.

    class SessionsController < ActionController::Base
      around_filter :retardase_inhibitor, :only => :create
      def create
        ...
      end
    end
